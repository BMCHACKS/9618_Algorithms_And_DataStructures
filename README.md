# hello world!

Note: Not All Variants have been added. The best general case has been made for Data Structures.

Things to ignore:

- If you're unused to looking at something like `def my_function(data: str | int) -> bool:`, then kindly consider it as `def my_function(data):` the data type was added to show the possible data-type(s) that can be passed as a parameter
- You can ignore the comments; they're to guide & explain the code (I'd recommend downloading the code & editing them off)


Well, that's all. 
Suppose you do find an error. Send an `issue,` or if you fix it, send a `pull request,` and I'll review it.
